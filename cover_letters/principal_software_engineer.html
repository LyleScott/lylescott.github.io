        <h3>Principal Software Engineer</h3>
        <p><em>I will be relocating to Beaverton, OR end-of-year 2020.</em></p>
        <p>My career has consistently straddled systems and software engineering which has allowed me to take on many job roles and duties; build/release, automation, full stack development, infrastructure and pipeline architectures. This has allowed me to have context on what should happen with a product in the planning phase as well as how to build, deliver, test, and monitor solutions from end-to-end. I've been the person delivering solutions by myself, but also managed the technical vision and higher level architecture where I'm supported by other development teams. Reasoning about the architecture, development paradigms, and graph of tasks to get there are very exciting to me.</p>
        <p>I have demonstrable experience leading backend, ops, and even QA teams and supporting many other teams in early startups. I've built engineering teams from scratch, creating the hiring funnel and I have a great track record for hiring best-fit engineers, not just the person that can do the job. Along with new teams, comes new processes. At several positions, I've architected code standards, cultivated best practices, and invented development workflows that include code-review, QA, and getting developers involved and invested in observability and owning their deliverables. I'm at my best at a deep technical level with engineers, but I also possess the confidence and focus on product to make sure the technical vision is justified and understood by other teams and organizations throughout the business. I'm not only a technical vision manager, but also a liaison between stakeholders and how to best get ideas and insights translated into actionable development items.</p>
        <p>I think this Principal Software Engineer position will allow me to scratch my many technical itches and continue to follow an engineering track while also allowing me to empower individual and teams of developers to build great things, with velocity, and also encourage personal and career growth to make sure all team members are happy and working at their full potential. It's not lost on me that a lead fights for technical decisions, but also for their people.</p>
        <p>I love working on all aspects of a software solutions and enjoy deep technical challenges. I enjoy many languages and enjoy learning new ones, so I am also adaptable and my experience allows me to pick things up pretty quickly.</p>
